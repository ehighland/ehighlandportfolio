				<h4>Origin Story</h4>
				<p>Emma comes to us from Hickory, North Carolina. Functionally, this means she gets riled up when folks pronounce "Appalachian" incorrectly. If you say "app-uh-lay-shun" you're part of the problem. Not part of the solution.<br />
				While in her hometown, she participated heavily in the local community theatre scene. Functionally, this means she has catalogs of show tunes lyrics etched permanently into her memory.</p>
				<p>Emma got her BS in Computer Science from Loyola University Chicago in 2017. She participated in academic research at Loyola, studying species divergence in the class Aves and later the regulation of gene expression in non-European human populations. She presented her avian research at conferences in Illinois, Indiana, and Texas. As part of her avian research, she led the development of the pipeline PyRANGER (<b>Py</b>thon <b>R</b>NA-seq <b>A</b>nalysis for <b>N</b>on-model <b>G</b>ene <b>E</b>xpression <b>R</b>esearch), for which she and her team received a publication in the coferences proceedings for the 2015 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)
