			<h4>Origin Story</h4>
			<div id="originstory">
				<p>
					Greetings! I am from Hickory, North Carolina. Functionally, this means I get riled up when folks pronounce "Appalachian" incorrectly.<br />
					<span style="font-size: 9pt">(Appa-LATCH-un <i>not</i>  Appa-LAY-shun)</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					As a kid, I drew all the time. I was a bookworm, too, and many of my drawings came with complicated back stories. Besides drawing, I participated heavily in the local community theatre scene. As such, I have catalogs of show tunes lyrics etched permanently into my memory. I practiced and learned techniques for singing, acting, and dancing (I still have my tap and character shoes). Community theatre was a huge part of my life as a child and teen. Many of the friends I had I made through theatre. It was an opportunity to be creative, to push my comfort level, and to further develop my admiration for the artists who put together a play or musical. There are so many moving pieces in a production, both onstage and behind the scenes. I am fortunate to have learned about how they all fit together to form a show.
				</p>

					I was also interested in academics. I developed an interest in computer science as a teen and planned to pursue this in college. Initially, I was interested in web design or video game design. However, my interests shifted once at Loyola University Chicago. I attended an event for new computer science students where each professor talked about their expertise, followed by a meet-and-greet. One professor, Dr. Putonti, talked about her research and the Bioinformatics program she had founded. I was intrigued and quickly became involved in the Bioinformatics program at Loyola. I participated heavily in academic research at Loyola, studying species divergence in the class Aves (with <a href="http://www.putonti-lab.com/" title="Dr. Putonti's lab website" target="_blank">Dr. Putonti</a> and <a href="http://www.reddylab.com/" title="Dr. Reddy's lab website" target="_blank">Dr. Reddy</a>) and later the regulation of gene expression in non-European human populations (with <a href="http://hwheeler01.github.io/" title="Dr. Wheeler's lab website" target="_blank">Dr. Wheeler</a>). I presented my avian research at conferences in Illinois, Indiana, and Texas. As part of this research, I led the development of the pipeline PyRANGER (<b>Py</b>thon <b>R</b>NA-seq <b>A</b>nalysis for <b>N</b>on-model <b>G</b>ene <b>E</b>xpression <b>R</b>esearch). My team and I wrote a paper about PyRANGER and we were published in the coferences proceedings for the 2015 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM).
				</p>
				<p>My pursuits were not limited to academics in Chicago. I also wrote and performed with a political sketch comedy group (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/democracyburlesque/" title="Facebook page for DB Comedy">DB Comedy</a>). I was raised on comedy and have been quoting SNL sketches from the 70s/80s since I was a child. With my theatre experience as a kid/tween/teen, I was comfortable performing. I had never done comedy writing before, but I quickly grew to love it. In addition to my work with DB Comedy, I've also had my work in the podcast <a href="http://thepubtheatre.com/the-sipping-hour/" title="Web page for The Sipping Hour podcast">The Sipping Hour</a>. After moving to Denver, CO, I worked on a new podcast called The Parallelocast. The core idea of the podcast was that each episode would be set in a different parallel universe, each with its own rules and norms. Although we only recorded two episodes, it was a fun process!
				</p>
				<p>I came to Denver to enroll in a PhD program. Sometimes things do not work out like we planned and we have to be flexible. I developed new goals and obtained an MS in Data Science from Regis University in Denver. I thoroughly enjoyed my undergraduate research experience with data analysis, which inspired this choice. I love data and this course of study was a better fit for me. Living in Denver also helped me realize that Chicago is home, so in 2019 I moved back. I am happy to be in Chicago once more, although not thrilled that a pandemic struck so soon after I returned! After moving back to Chicago, I worked remotely as an R Programmer for a year for the Denver-based company MANA RBM. I transitioned out of this role to attend a second MS program, this time an MS in Computer Science from my alma mater. The degree is on hold for now while I continue to pursue my career, but I am glad I took the time to return to graduate classes to refresh my knowledge.
