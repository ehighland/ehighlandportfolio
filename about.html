				<h4>Origin Story</h4>
				<p>
					Greetings! I am from Hickory, North Carolina. Functionally, this means I get riled up when folks pronounce "Appalachian" incorrectly.<br />
					<span style="font-size: 9pt">(Appa-LATCH-un <i>not</i>  Appa-LAY-shun)</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					As a kid, I drew all the time. I was a bookworm, too, and many of my drawings came with complicated back stories that I was extremely ready to rattle off. I was into various art forms as a kid. Besides drawing, I participated heavily in the local community theatre scene. As such, I have catalogs of show tunes lyrics etched permanently into my memory. I was not at triple threat status, but I practiced and learned techniques for singing, acting, and dancing (I still have my tap and character shoes). Community theatre was a huge part of my life as a child and teen. Many of the friends I had I made through theatre. It was an opportunity to be creative, to push my comfort level, and to further develop my admiration for the artists who put together a play or musical. There are so many moving pieces in a production, both onstage and behind the scenes. It's truly outstanding. I am fortunate to have learned about these moving pieces and how they all fit together to form a show.

					I was also interested in academics. I developed an interest in computer science as a teen and planned to pursue this in college. Initially I was interested in design as well, either in the form of web design or video game design. However, my interests shifted once at Loyola University Chicago. After attending a meet-and-greet with computer sciences professors at school, I became involved in the Bioinformatics program at Loyola. I participated heavily in academic research at Loyola, studying species divergence in the class Aves and later the regulation of gene expression in non-European human populations. I presented my avian research at conferences in Illinois, Indiana, and Texas. As part of this research, I led the development of the pipeline PyRANGER (<b>Py</b>thon <b>R</b>NA-seq <b>A</b>nalysis for <b>N</b>on-model <b>G</b>ene <b>E</b>xpression <b>R</b>esearch). My team and I wrote a paper about PyRANGER and we were published in the coferences proceedings for the 2015 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM).

					My pursuits were not limited to academics in Chicago. I also wrote and performed with a political sketch comedy group (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/democracyburlesque/" title="Facebook page for DB Comedy">DB Comedy</a>). I was raised on comedy and have been quoting SNL sketches from the 70s/80s since I was a child. With my theatre experience as a kid/tween/teen, I was comfortable performing. I had never done comedy writing before, but I quickly grew to love it. In addition to my work with DB Comedy, I've also had my work in the podcast <a href="http://thepubtheatre.com/the-sipping-hour/" title="Web page for The Sipping Hour podcast">The Sipping Hour</a>. Now that I am in Denver, I have worked on a new podcast called The Parallelocast. This project is evolving, but I am confident it's headed in a good direction. The core idea is that each episode is set in a different parallel universe, with its own rules and norms.
				</p>
				<p>
					As stated above, I'm in Denver now. I started off attenting a PhD program at CU Anschutz. Sometimes things do not work out like we planned and we have to be flexible. At present, I've pivoted academic/career goals again and am pursuing an MS in Data Science. I thoroughly enjoyed my undergraduate research experience with data analysis, which inspired this choice. I love data so it's working out pretty good.
