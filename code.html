					I have a variety of projects on GitHub. You can view them <a href="https://github.com/ehighland" title="Link to my GitHub account" target="_blank">right here</a>. Some repositories contain more recent personal projects and some contain assignments from my undergrad classes.<br /><br />
					My personal projects include this website! And also:
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://github.com/ehighland/goats_stats">Goats Stats</a>: I used sentiment polarity scores for song lyrics by the Mountain Goats to classify albums as belonging to their lo-fi or hi-fi period. I did this for both word-tokenized and sentence-tokenized lyrics from 16 different albums. I tested four different machine learning algorithms: Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest.
						</li>
						<li><a href="https://github.com/ehighland/actor_or_movie">Actor or Movie?: Classifying Wikipedia Articles</a>: I used part-of-speech and named entity recognition tagging on word-tokenized Wikipedia pages for 10 actors and for 10 movies. Using counts of the most common POS and NER tags per actor and per movie, I was able to classify the articles as belonging to the Actors category or the Movies category. I tested three different maching learning algorithms: Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Gradient Boosting.
						</li>
						<li><a href="https://github.com/ehighland/cage_data">Cage Data</a>: I curated a Nic Cage data set using information from IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes. 
						</li>
					</ul>
					<br />
					My school project I am most proud of is a hi-fi mockup of my idea for a redesign for <a href="https://www.mendeley.com/" title="Link to Mendeley website" target="_blank">Mendley desktop</a>. I had worked on this project with another student for the Human-Computer Interface Design class (<a href="http://courses.cs.luc.edu/html/comp441.html" title="Link to Loyola Chicago's course page for COMP 441" target="_blank">COMP 441</a>) at Loyola University Chicago. I really enjoyed learning about making an interface intuitive for the user.
