# My portfolio
This is the repo for my personal website. It is a collection of my work, divided into four areas:

- Code
- Art
- Writing
- Research

Each section contains a link to a Drive folder (or, in the case of "Code", my GitHub page). I have also included an overview of my work in each area and its significance.
