# My portfolio
This is the repo for my personal website. It contains some information
about me, how to contact me, and a collection of my 
work, divided into four categories:

- Code
- Art
- Writing
- Research

Each page contains information and links relevant to that category. 
I have also included a blurb about the personal significance of the 
category and/or my history and experience with it.
